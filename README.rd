CS401 Assignment 3
6/19/19

I realize that I did not turn this in for the first submission, I did not turn
anything in because I did not have much worth grading. 

I was quite close to finishing the code on this submission, and the queries were looking very nice. However, while I figured out (or believe I figured out) the logic for the queries, I had some serious generic type errors that I was not able to fix in time. The DB fills completely and correctly, but the queries do not work (although if you get errors using a .csv file you have, try using the one I included, I messed with the first line but I am not sure why it did not work before. The error may have been with Eclipse).
